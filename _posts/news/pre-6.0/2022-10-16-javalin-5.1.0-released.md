version: 5.1.0
title: Javalin 5.1.0 has been released
summary: Async, static-files, http-status and slf4j fixes!
---

## Cleaning up some async problems
The `Context#async` signature released in 5.0.0 used the Kotlin `Result` type, which does not work from Java.
We caught this a bit late, and had to rework the method. Our apologies!

## Static files after server start
We've made it possible to add more static file location after the server has been started.

## Fixing HttpStatus.forStatus
The `HttpStatus.forStatus(int)` method was not directly available from Java
(you had to do `HttpStatus.companion.forStatus(int)`). This has been fixed.

## SLF4J v2
Jetty moved to SLF4J v2 in v11, which caused dependency conflicts in some cases.
We've also moved Javalin SLF4J to v2 now.
